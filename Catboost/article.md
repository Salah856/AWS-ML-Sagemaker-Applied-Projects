# Edelweiss improves cross-sell using machine learning on Amazon SageMaker


How are you being recommended a credit card based on your savings account behavior? How about a life insurance product when you buy car insurance, or a side dish when you order a main course on your food ordering app? These are done using a practice called cross-sell, which invites customers to buy related or complimentary items based on their current purchases. In the insurance business particularly, it’s often easier to cross-sell to existing customers than to acquire new customers. 

For example, the odds are better of selling an investment or retirement policy to an existing life insurance customer than trying to approach a random new lead.

However, if the cross-sell approach isn’t data driven, it often leads to the wrong selection of customers or policies. If you’re annoyed at times when an irrelevant product is being offered to you repeatedly, the cross-sell strategy didn’t do a good job. For businesses, this results in missed opportunities and diminished customer-satisfaction.
