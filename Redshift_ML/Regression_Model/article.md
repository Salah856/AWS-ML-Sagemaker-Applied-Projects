# Build regression models with Amazon Redshift ML 

With the rapid growth of data, many organizations are finding it difficult to analyze their large datasets to gain insights. As businesses rely more and more on automation algorithms, machine learning (ML) has become a necessity to stay ahead of the competition.

Amazon Redshift, a fast, fully managed, widely used cloud data warehouse, natively integrates with Amazon SageMaker for ML. With Amazon Redshift ML, you can use simple SQL statements to create and train ML models from your data in Amazon Redshift and then use these models for a variety of use cases, such as classification of a binary or multiclass outcome or predicting a numeric value through regression. Amazon SageMaker Autopilot provides all the benefits of automatic model creation, but as an advanced user, you can also influence the model training by providing different parameters such as model type, objective, and so on.
